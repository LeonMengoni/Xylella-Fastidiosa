# Modeling the spread of Xylella Fastidiosa in Apulia, Italy

## What is Xylella?
**_Xylella fastidiosa_** is a bacterial pathogen that is transmitted by insect vectors feeding on xylem sap from trees. 
Xylem cells act as tubes that transport water and nutrients (sap) from the soil up to the branches and leaves. 
The bacterium acts by obstructing the flow of nutrients through the xylem network, causing the tree to slowly die out, starting from the leaves and proceeding up to the main trunk.
Common symptoms are leaf scorching, stunting and wilting, and a reduction in the size and quality of fruit production.

The effects of the disease were first discovered and reported by Newton B. Pierce in the late 19th century.
The identification of the bacterium occurred only much later, in the 1970s.
Since then, the bacterium and the disease have been widely studied. 

The bacterium is typically found in areas ranging from tropical to temperate.
It is native to the Americas, but has also been detected in Europe, the Middle East and in the Far East. 
In the Americas, it has been responsible for Pierce's disease in grapevines, citrus variegated chlorosis and coffee leaf scorch, while in Europe it is mainly responsible for Olive Quick Decline Syndrome (OQDS). 
In 2013 it was detected in the southern region of Puglia, in Italy, and has since spread all over the Salentine peninsula (the "heel" of the "boot").

There are multiple strains of the bacteria: _Xylella fastidiosa_ subsp. _fastidiosa_, subsp. _pauca_, subsp. _multiplex_, subsp. _sandyi_, etc.
The strain that is prevalent in Puglia is the _pauca_ subspecies. 

The bacterium is spread by spittlebugs, froghoppers and sharpshooter leafhoppers, which are all xylem sap-feeding insects. 
Philaenus spumarius, the meadow froghopper or spittlebug, is considered the most important vector in Italy and in the EU, since it is the only one (proven so far) to transmit the bacterium in natural conditions.
These insects thrive and lay eggs in weeds in the spring months.
The young spittlebugs — nymphs — are born in the protected environment of a foam nest and, as summer approaches, they grow out of the dried out foam nest into adults.
The nymphs have reduced mobility compared to adult vectors (which can jump up to 70 cm), and feed only on herbaceous hosts (weeds), while the latter feed also on woody hosts.
Therefore, monitoring campaigns focus mostly, if not completely, on adult vectors. 
The figure below (taken from [[1]](#1)) summarizes the vectors' life cycle.
